<h1>I am Himadhar.</h1>
<p>Started my career in 2010 and have gained immense experience in roles spanning from conceptualizing, designing and
  developing UI, having worked on major domains â€“ Banking, Luxury and Hospitality, R&amp;D, Infrastructure, Automation
  technology and Healthcare and have worked in various capacities from being an Individual Contributor to a Team Lead.
</p>
<p>I am a Google certified UX designer, with exposure to front end development platforms. This allows me to be able to
  bridge well between the design and development ecosystems, create a design that can be seamlessly handed over to
  development and code for the project to deliver it too.</p>

<h4>Surpam - A test and grading system</h4>
<p>Surpam (Surprise Assessments) was designed to cater for the idea of self-evaluation with a mentor to guide. Surpam is
  an online test curator dedicated to teachers and students. A typical teacher posts a questionnaire frequently and
  assigns them as tests to their students. A student gets to participate in these tests and grade themselves on the
  training they received. The goal is to make both teachers and students aware of the current state of learning and gain
  insights into them. <br /><a rel="noreferrer noopener"

<h4><strong style="font-size: 1.4em;">H-Slider</strong></h4>
<p>H-Slider is a plugin to handle sliding effects in a web application. It's a jQuery based plugin designed to handle
  multiple scenarios where plugins change their look and feel.</p>
<p>For example, if the carousel is images based, then the same can be built. If the carousel/slider is supposed to
  provide thumbnails of listed actions (like a list of dates, or pagination controls), H-Slider comes in handy. There
  are a majority of items available in the plugin and can be viewed by&nbsp;<a
    href="https://github.com/himadhar/h-slider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the plugin here</a> along with
  complete information of all the params and ways to use it as per your needs.</p>
<p>On a side note, you can use this to improve your skills based on the earlier <a
    title="post on creating a jquery plugin" href="http://himadhar.com/?p=254" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on

<h4><strong style="font-size: 1.4em;">H-Grid</strong></h4>
<p>H-Grid is a jquery based plugin designed to provide elementary table view solutions. This includes building a table
  dynamically, including pagination and its types (dropdown, etc), edit feature on each column of data on the entire
  grid and a couple of others.</p>

<h4><strong style="font-size: 1.4em;">HOfflineJS</strong></h4>
<p>Many websites are focusing on getting their offline pages to work - If the internet goes off midway and they still
  want to complete the end-users transactions. But challenges lie where identifying whether the internet exists or not
  becomes a challenge. The browsers do give a way to find the connectivity type that can be achieved through the
  navigator object. But, this is limited to only the internet source - 3G/4G or WIFI. If the internet doesn't exist,
  even then the navigator.onLine returns true, since WiFi exists, for example.</p>
<p>HOffline is a jquery based plugin focused to provide a solution where internet connection is to be tested. I have <a
