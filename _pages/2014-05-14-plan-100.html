<p><strong>One World, One Plan</strong></p>

<p>I was inspired by a few people in my life - teachers, family members, few mentors, involved in various social causes. I discussed with one such mentor, with whom, I got to discuss what we could contribute among other things. When asked, what exactly that he is involved in, he said, there are many people with good intentions to be socially helpful. But do not have a source to do it at a united pace and they die down eventually. And added to that, these people with good intentions usually involve in a small NGO and do their bit until the intention dies down. Instead, if like-minded NGOs are united to form larger chunks of people with like-minded goals, their purpose becomes more clear and they get more genuinely involved in the social activities. That is how his organization was formed. An NGO to unite NGOs. That is what inspired me to come up with this Plan 100.</p>

<p>I have this idea of setting up a bank account, where anyone who is willing to, will donate 100 rupees to this account. The account created this way will be completely dedicated to social causes and will donate only to trusted NGOs. Obviously, for me to do this, I would need your trust first. But just not it. I also need your help in setting this up and making it as transparent as possible for anyone to pitch in and volunteer at any point in time.</p>

<p><strong>But why 100?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I have observed quite a few of my friends who are OK with sharing a "100" for a good cause. I have also noticed that, if it is a little less, they grow suspicious, and a little more and they think it's too much. 100 as a number, gives a sense of ease in it, and if anybody who donates a 100, has less feeling of loss and hopefully, knows that it's going for a good cause and gain happiness out of it.</p>

<p><strong>How - Project100?</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am partly associated with an NGO - <a href="https://keshavasevasamithi.org/">Keshava Seva Samithi</a>. I have seen their work, have <strong>actually</strong> seen them do work, and am also proud to have worked with them in the past. They could be a good start for you. <a href="https://keshavasevasamithi.org/">Visit their website</a> and understand their work and maybe that will help you make your mind. If you have any NGO that you think, have been selfless in its entirety, then please do share their details. But that should be step two.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For now, the first step is to set up a process, a framework sort, which will allow anybody to donate with complete trust and peace of mind that it's been utilized in a positive and secure way. I need your help to first separate areas to be covered in this aspect and technical support to proceed ahead. For this, I think focusing on 3 primary things would be sufficient:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>The entire initial focus must be on setting up a payment gateway and a secure mode to establish it.</li>
<li>We can then proceed with identifying the right NGOs to tag to this project. Where every cash in-flow is redirected to them need-based.</li>
<li>And, if lucky enough to have grown into a huge organization, involve more and more NGOs to make philanthropy a way of providing peace of mind to people.</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>"Plan 100 - Current Itinerary" is a page dedicated to such projects where I will share information for the project at hand and about the people behind the task. This page will have all the required information about the organization and its activities if it is an NGO or a team working on it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Please do kindly share your views on this and any suggestions to make this a success. Let's work towards making life worth living.</p>
