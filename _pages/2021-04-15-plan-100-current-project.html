<p>I have completed the compound wall and the gate is placed. It costed me around ₹32,000/-. Hopefully, if possible I will try getting the paint job done and CCTV maybe? Not sure. Exhausted my budget for now :)</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Z3KWxH13YLNXjrGN7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Kutumba Kalyana Kendra</strong> located in the <strong>Horamavu Agara, Bengaluru</strong></a><strong>, </strong>is a Family Welfare Centre by Government specialised in the free vaccination of kids up to 5 years of age. The centre is crucial for underprivileged people in the area and sees approximately 20 or more new mothers visiting with their babies twice every week on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>

<h4>Problem</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Due to lack of upkeep and neglect, the centre is in a poor state and in desperate need of betterment. The centre operates during the peak hot morning hours and there is no seating arrangement and the mothers have to stand in a queue in the hot sun while carrying their children. Besides this, due to the lack of proper walls and a gate, and due to the centre only being operational on two days of the week, the building has also started attracting unruly activities like people using it to drink, gamble, and even urinate. Such conditions are very detrimental to the physical and mental health of mothers and newborns.</p>

<h4>Plan</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"dropCap":true} --></p>
<p class="has-drop-cap">To rectify these problems, I have decided to carry out a crowdsourced renovation project. The plan is to get the walls raised to 6ft and install a sturdy entrance gate, along with benches for the women and children to sit. These changes will help make the mothers and children comfortable and to keep the unwanted elements away from the premises. </p>

<h4>Cost and Steps</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The estimated cost of the project is <strong>₹45,000</strong>. I ask all who believe helping underprivileged mothers and their toddlers is a worthy cause, to come forth and donate whatever amount they find reasonable and comfortable giving away, no matter how big or small. The world could really use your help. Please connect with me via Email/WhatsApp/Call to know more about the project. Once convinced about it, you can transfer to me via GPay/PhonePay/PayTM with subject <strong>strictly as "Plan100-FWCR"</strong> as it helps me list better. <br /><em>(Note: FWCR is short for Family Welfare Center Renovation).</em></p>
