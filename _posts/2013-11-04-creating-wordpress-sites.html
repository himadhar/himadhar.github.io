<p>All I had to do was choose around a million options I had to host a site, and with <a href="http://in.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>&nbsp;and many others offering web hosting facilities, this was an easy step. With amazing tutorials &nbsp;and articles explaining every possible issue and solutions to them, <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>&nbsp;seemed to be an ideal option. Since its core is completely built out of PHP, playing around the toys it offers is a great fun and an even greater opportunity to learn. If you have anything to suggest as an improvement, kindly leave a reply.</p>
