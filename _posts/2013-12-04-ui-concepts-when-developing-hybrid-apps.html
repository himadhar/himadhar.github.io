<p>Being a app designer has its own perks in terms of exposure towards being updated to the latest guidelines for an excellent user experience among varied platforms. But, as a designer, one has to understand every possibility before deciding on a particular layout. For example, if the app is built in native then must retain the branding and other generic areas and if possible, a consistency in look and feel.</p>
<p>But while developing a common application for all platforms like Android, iOS etc., if user interface <!--more-->consistency is mandatory among each of them, developing them using hybrid tools like <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>&nbsp;or others is the most economical way and is also simplistic.</p>
<p>One of the best approach I've come across, is using a Flat layout approach where, the entire User interface appears to be created / drawn using basic geometric layouts like circles or squares and designing aesthetically decent user interface which, when used in various platforms like Android, iOS, BlackBerry or even the latest OSes like Sailfish or Tizen and still look pretty neat.</p>
<p>Flat design is a minimalistic design approach that emphasizes usability. It features clean, open space, crisp edges, bright colors and two-dimensional/flat illustrations.&nbsp;It offers many comfortable options which will help the designers as well as the developers in creating the entire application and also debug easily throughout the process. Additionally, the end-users have a clear view of every content and this helps them in performing every activity it offers in a smoother and clearer way.</p>
<p>With each layout designed to provide the highest clarity, the end user is left satisfied with his experience on the application. Designing such a layout/screen demands focus on primarily <strong>two</strong> aspects, <strong>Crisp illustrations</strong> with vivid colors to give a sense of clean UI with excellent differential detailing and <strong>thoroughly thought over typography</strong> like any sans serif&nbsp;font, which offers the best reading capability in lower PPIs(as low as 200PPI -400 PPI) which is common in digital media.</p>
<p>Examples for such flat designs can be find everywhere like the <a href="http://talkslab.com/metro-bootstrap/components.html">Metro UI from Twitter Bootstrap</a>, or apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinterest&amp;hl=en">Pinterest</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm&amp;hl=en">Gmail </a>among others found on Android Play store.</p>
<p>I have always preferred Flat UIs over others for all the reasons I just mentioned, and if you feel it needs anything to be added or may you agree too with it, drop a comment :)</p>
