<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">Google</strong> <strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">AdSense</strong> has been one of the most popular and simplest mechanisms to monetise a website. All you have to do, is request Google to provide with the code for Ads and add it in your site, and yes, its that simple.</p>
<p>Google has continuously evolved in various activities with ads being their primary area of focus. A quick video on what <a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;" title="Google AdSense" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAceed8sW1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdSense</a>&nbsp;gives an overview on what it actually is and how it could benefit. It&nbsp;is, as they put it, a free, simple way for website publishers of all sizes to earn money by displaying targeted Google ads on their websites. Since, the <!--more-->content of the ads are completely dependent on the users, these ads are neatly served only based on the end-user's area of interest.&nbsp;AdSense offers cost-per-click ads (CPC) which means that you earn money every time a user clicks on the ad on your website. The amount received per click varies based on multiple factors.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">&nbsp;Getting Started<br />
</strong>The first step in enabling it in your site, is to create an AdSense account. Any existing Google account should serve the purpose. You can also create a new account by signing up in their site.</p>
<p>To complete the registration, you need to complete two steps. Firstly, create an ad, and then place it in your site.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Click on My Ads tab and proceed by creating a new ad unit.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_202" align="alignnone" width="502"]<img class=" wp-image-202 " alt="Step 1 in creating an AdSense" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/10/step1.png" width="502" height="154" /> Google AdSense: Step 1[/caption]</p>
<p>Provide a title and choose the preferred ad settings (layout, Ad type, display colors, backup ads) &nbsp;and save.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_203" align="alignnone" width="714"]<img class=" wp-image-203  " alt="Google AdSense: Step 2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/10/step2.png" width="714" height="490" /> Google AdSense: Step 2[/caption]</p>
<p>Once you have successfully submitted the details, Google will provide you with an Ad inducing snippet to be placed in your site.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_204" align="alignnone" width="539"]<img class=" wp-image-204 " alt="Google AdSense: Step 3" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/10/step3.png" width="539" height="371" /> Google AdSense: Step 3[/caption]</p>
<p>Just copy this piece of code into your website, to whichever location you want it to be and you are done!</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">Areas to Focus<br />
</strong>You cannot modify the website URL you provide while creating an AdSense account.<br />
You will not be able to use the same Google ID to create an account, which is already in processing or which has been rejected.<br />
AdSense offers cost-per-click ads (CPC) which means that you earn money every time a user clicks on the ad on your website. and this amount can vary based on multiple factors.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.2em;">Recommendations<br />
</strong>There is no rule as to where exactly to place the Ad. Place wherever you are comfortable with in your site. In WordPress blogs, you can use <a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 600;" title="Widgets" href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-create-a-sticky-floating-sidebar-widget-in-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Widgets</a>&nbsp;to place the Ads section in whichever place you wish very easily.<br />
Google is very smart. It has very complicated algorithms to identify who has, and how is he related to you. That means, you clicking on these ads randomly or your friends clicking it often, might get you (your account) banned from the website.<br />
<strong>RPM (</strong>Revenue per Mille) or revenue per 1000 impressions is determined by multiplying the total number of clicks and cost per click and then dividing that by the total number of page views.</p>
