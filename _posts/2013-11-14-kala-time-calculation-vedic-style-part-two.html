<p>In continuation with the <a href="http://himadhar.com/?p=53">previous post</a>, I would like to continue in explaining what and how calculations are made from a <strong>Samvatsara</strong> (Year)'s level up-to what it means for a day in a <strong>Brahma's</strong> life and how is it related to band in turn how its related to <strong>Shiva</strong>.</p>
<p>As we understand, each year is formed of two parts, a <strong>Uttarayana</strong> and a <strong>Dakshinayana</strong>. They together form a day of the Gods, <!--more--><strong>Uttarayana</strong> being the day and <strong>Dakshinayana</strong> being the night for the Gods which approximately comes around 360 of human days.</p>
<p>According to <strong>Vishnu Purana,&nbsp;</strong>a day of <strong>Brahma </strong>(Creator) is calculated as 2 <strong>Kalps</strong>.&nbsp;To understand how many years of a human takes to form a day of <strong>Brahma,&nbsp;</strong>I have added below a calculation to describe the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Day of the Gods = 2 <strong>Ayanas</strong> = 1 human year</li>
<li>1 Year of Gods = 1 <strong>Daiva</strong> (Divine) year = 360 <strong>Samvatsaras&nbsp;</strong>= 360 human years</li>
<li>1000 + 100 + 100 = 1200 Divine years = 1200 * 360 = 432,000 human years =&nbsp;1 <strong>Charana</strong></li>
<li>4000 + 400 + 400 = 4800 Divine years = 4800 * 360 = 1,728,000 human years = 4 <strong>Charanas</strong> = 1 <strong>Satya Yug</strong></li>
<li>3000 + 300 + 300 = 3600&nbsp;Divine years = 3600 * 360 =&nbsp;1,296,000 human years = 3 <strong>Charanas</strong> = 1 <strong>Treta Yug</strong></li>
<li>2000 + 200 + 200 = 2400 Divine years = 2400 * 360 =&nbsp;864,000 human years = 2 <strong>Charanas</strong> = 1 <strong>Dwapara Yug</strong></li>
<li>1000 + 100 + 100 = 1200 Divine years = 1200 * 360 = 432,000 human years&nbsp;= 1 <strong>Charana</strong> =&nbsp;1 <strong>Kali Yug</strong></li>
<li>Sum of these years = 12000 Divine years = 4,320,000 human years = 10 <strong>Charanas</strong> = 1 <strong>Maha Yug</strong></li>
<li>2*12,000 = 24,000 divine year = 12000 revolutions of sun around it's dual also referred as the seat of Brahma</li>
</ul>
<p>Each cycle of a <strong>Manvantara</strong>&nbsp;consists of 71 <strong>Maha Yugs </strong>(306.72 billion human years) and is ruled by a Manu (considered as the progenitor). We now are in the 28th cycle of the&nbsp;7th<strong> Manvantara&nbsp;</strong>and are governed by the&nbsp;<strong>Vaivasvata Manu.&nbsp;</strong>After each <strong>Manvatara,&nbsp;</strong> a <strong>Samdhi kala&nbsp;</strong>(equivalent to 4 <strong>Charanas</strong> or 1,728,000 human years) during which, it is believed that, the world will be submerged into water.A&nbsp;parallel to this <strong>Manu</strong> is also drawn to <strong>Moses</strong> from Bible, since there is a narration of how this&nbsp;<strong>Manu</strong> saved the earth from the <strong>Great Flood&nbsp;</strong>(who's parallel can again, be drawn towards the <strong>Samdhi Kala</strong>)<strong>&nbsp;</strong> after being warned by the <strong>Matsya</strong> (fish) avatar/form of <strong>Vishnu.</strong></p>
<p>Now we come to part of calculating the age of <strong>Brahma</strong>.&nbsp;The <strong>Maha Yugs&nbsp;</strong> keep repeating itself and a&nbsp;1000 such <strong>Maha Yugs </strong>form a <strong>Kalp</strong>&nbsp;and 2 such <strong>Kalps</strong>&nbsp;a single day of&nbsp;<strong>Brahma&nbsp;</strong>(the Creator) &nbsp;with each <strong>Kalp </strong>forming the day and night of <strong>Brahma</strong>&nbsp;respectively. This is equivalent to 8,640,000 or 8.64 million human years.</p>
<ul>
<li>14&nbsp;<strong>Manvantaras</strong>&nbsp;+ 15&nbsp;<strong>Samdhi</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Kalas</strong>&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;<strong>Kalp</strong></li>
<li>14 * 71&nbsp;<strong>Maha</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Yugs</strong>&nbsp;+ 15 * 4&nbsp;<strong>Charanas</strong>&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;<strong>Kalp</strong></li>
<li>994&nbsp;<strong>Maha</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Yugs</strong>&nbsp;+ 15 *&nbsp;4800&nbsp;Divine years&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;<strong>Kalp</strong></li>
<li>994&nbsp;<strong>Maha</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Yugs</strong>&nbsp;+ 72000 Divine years = 1&nbsp;<strong>Kalp</strong></li>
<li>994&nbsp;<strong>Maha</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Yugs</strong>&nbsp;+ 6&nbsp;<strong>Maha Yugs&nbsp;</strong>= 1000&nbsp;<strong><strong>Maha Yugs&nbsp;= 1&nbsp;<strong>Kalp</strong></strong></strong></li>
<li>2&nbsp;<strong>Kalp&nbsp;</strong>= 1 Day of&nbsp;<strong>Brahma</strong></li>
<li>30 such days of&nbsp;<strong>Brahma </strong>=<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a month of&nbsp;<strong>Brahma&nbsp;</strong>=&nbsp;259.2 million human years</li>
<li>12 months of&nbsp;<strong>Brahma&nbsp;</strong>= 1 year of <strong>Brahma&nbsp;</strong>= 3.1104 billion human years</li>
<li>50 such years = 1 <strong>Parardha&nbsp;</strong> = 155.52 billion human years</li>
<li>2 <strong>Parardhas&nbsp;</strong>= 100&nbsp;<strong>Brahma&nbsp;</strong>years = 1 lifespan of&nbsp;<strong>Brahma&nbsp;</strong>=&nbsp;&nbsp;1<strong> Maha Kalp&nbsp;</strong>= 3.1104 trillion human years</li>
</ul>
<p>1 such lifespan of <strong>Brahma&nbsp;</strong>equals to a single breath in and breath out of <strong>Vishnu </strong>and this in-turn leads to calculating his age and a multiples of his lifespan amounts to a single day of <strong>Shiva</strong>. Thus <strong>Shiva</strong> has no end or no beginning, where as <strong>Brahma</strong> and <strong>Vishnu</strong> continue to be reborn and repeat the cycle of birth and sustenance until of everything that gets created until <strong>Shiva</strong> puts them to an end.</p>
<p>And now, I come to the end of explaining what Time means according Vedic calculations.&nbsp;All the explanations done till now to explain sounds very accurate but at the same time sounds vague too. Many questions arise such as,</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly does a <strong>Brahma&nbsp;</strong>mean and why is he referred to as the creator?</li>
<li>What does a <strong>Vishnu</strong>&nbsp;mean and why does <strong>Manu</strong> take his help in saving the world? What does it mean that&nbsp;<strong>Vishnu&nbsp;</strong>takes several forms to rescue the world?</li>
<li>What does a <strong>Shiva</strong> mean? What does it mean that&nbsp;<strong>Shiva&nbsp;</strong>doesn't have a death.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have put efforts in understanding these terms and calculations and if you feel that I have missed out anything or if there are any parts where you could guide me, you can drop a comment below or email me and I'll get back to you. :)</p>
