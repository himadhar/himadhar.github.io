<p>I am always amazed by the way developers visualize what to display to the users. One such example is the <a title="Gmail" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gmail</a>&nbsp;app for Android devices where the entire focus is given to ease the users. The comfort level it offers to the users is excellent.</p>
<p>Most of the apps that garner maximum downloads are successful only because their purpose is neatly attended to, with attention provided to every details. The user feels comfortable using it through its entirety and based on the goal and clarity of the app, its shelf life gets defined. There are  <!--more-->amazing apps out there in the respective app-stores through which users get whatever they want and have been into their existence since they came into the picture.</p>
<p>An awesome camera app like <a title="ProCapture" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neaststudios.procapture&amp;hl=en">Pro Capture</a>, offers brilliant features for users to become as an amateur photographer. It offers different controls like temperature, ISO among others. Its Panorama feature is neatly made. But its of only one axis. A vertical path or a horizontal one. How about an app that captures the visual entity placed in front of the user entirely by allowing user to capture an image on both axes. I stand in front of a mirror and try for a selfie and capture the entire me at a single go - left to right, top to bottom at one attempt. A large canvas of mountains in front of you, and you want to capture everything in it - the lake below, the trees on the left and the mountains on the right, and the clear sky above, you use this app and Voila! everything at one go.</p>
<p>This app - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.contapps.android">Contacts+</a>, has an excellent approach where the contacts are brlillantly handled. The dial option sorts contacts based on dial frequencies and syncs all the contacts in a neat order with the contact with most calls at the lead. How about taking this to one step ahead. How about, knowing whether or not to call a person even before talking to them, or better, even before you dial them? Every user with this application sets his/her status and their statuses appears - "Can't pick calls between 3pm - 4pm" , "Driving right now for next 45 minutes. Call me later" and so on, on whoever tries to reach out to them. And to add to it, how about displaying whether the person in the contact is right now on a call - "In a call from 4:35 minutes". This way, you just see the contact and decide whether or not to call the person.</p>
<p>Discussing with few of my friends / programmers, I can only assume that these thoughts are only steps to proceed in the direction of progress. There are many ways to push boundaries and all it takes is just visualize. There are many brilliant minds working in this direction, of improving the quality of approach in conceptualizing applications and going ahead to implement them.</p>
