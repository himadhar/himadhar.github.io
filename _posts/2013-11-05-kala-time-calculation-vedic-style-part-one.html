<p>We all probably understand that time is precious and has to be planned accordingly to have a successful day which leads to a successful lifestyle and a balanced life to summarize. But ever wondered how time is calculated? I mean, how each day means something? And when it means something, it might probably also have a definition too? To begin with, let's try answering few basic questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What exactly does a 10th of January falling on Monday mean?<!--more--></li>
<li>What does it mean when the same 10th, falls on a Tuesday in the next year?</li>
<li>How is each day constituted, and why should we even know about it?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mathematical calculations done to calculate a day/ a month or an year is weakly established in the Gregorian Calendar. Some of the calculations like correcting the calendar every 4 years (Leap year) will help stabilize the days in a year but it will eventually be nullified and so a possible correction of the calendar every few thousands or may be even hundreds of years is possible. So why then follow it?</p>
<p>To answer the above questions, which may sound trivial too, I consulted some of my friends and mentors and I got some very interesting facts and artifacts that makes me very proud to be a Bhratiya. The sense of Time (<strong>Kala</strong>) was already present in Bharat (India) even before the world knew about civilization.&nbsp;The <em>Shrimad Bhagavatha Mahapuranam</em> has explained this about 5000 years back ( that makes it 3070BC !!). What time means and how is it supposed to be calculated has been neatly explained and it all begins with the basic unit of time called <strong>Paramanu</strong>.</p>
<p>A Paramanu (Sub-atomic level) is basically the tiniest possible unit of time/particle and Sage <strong>Mithreya</strong> (Author of <em>Shrimad Bhagavatha Mahapuranam&nbsp;</em>) in his book says,&nbsp;“The smallest particle of material substance, which has not yet combined with any other similar particles, is called Paramanu (a sub-atomic particle of matter). Paramanus always exist both in the dormant and manifest states of material existence. It is the combination of more than one <em>Paramanu</em> (sub-atomic particle) which gives rise to the illusory concept of a (material) unit.</p>
<p>Ever wondered when you mentioned <strong>Kshan</strong>&nbsp;while referring to some task and never knew how long it is? And are astonished to find that, it is actually a mathematically calculated unit if time and is approximately the time taken for a person to blink? Keep reading :D</p>
<p><strong>Paramanu</strong> as a source and basic unit of time is calculated as, the time taken by the Sun rays to pass through them.</p>
<ul>
<li>A combination of 2 <strong>Paramanus </strong>(about&nbsp;26.3 µs) makes an <strong>Anu </strong>/ Atom (about&nbsp;57.7 µs).</li>
<li>3 Atoms form a <strong>Thrasarenu </strong>(about 158 µs)</li>
<li>3&nbsp;<strong>Thrasarenus</strong> form a <strong>Thruthi </strong>(about&nbsp;474 µs /&nbsp;8/13,500 of a second)</li>
<li>A combination 100 <strong>Thruthis </strong>is called a <strong>Vedha </strong>(about 47.4&nbsp;µs /&nbsp;8/135 of a second)</li>
<li>3 <strong>Vedhas </strong>together form a <strong>Lava </strong>(about 8/45 of a second) and 3 <strong>Lavas </strong>together are called a <strong>Kshana </strong>(about&nbsp;8/5 of a second)</li>
<li>5 <strong>Kshanas </strong>form a <strong>Kaashta </strong>(about&nbsp;6.4 seconds) and a combination of 15 <strong>Kaashtas </strong>form a <strong>Laghu </strong>(about 1.6 Minutes)</li>
<li>15 <strong>Laghus </strong>make a <strong>Danda</strong> (24 minutes) and 2 <strong>Dandas </strong>combine to form a <strong>Muhurtam </strong>(48 minutes)</li>
<li>3¾ <strong>Muhurtams </strong>make a <strong>Yama </strong>(3 hours) and 2 <strong>Yamas </strong>make a <strong>Prahara </strong>(A quarter of a day : 6 hours)</li>
<li>30 <strong>Muhurtams </strong>= 8 <strong>Yamas </strong>= 4 <strong>Praharas </strong>combine to make a <strong>Thithi </strong>( a single Day / 24 hours) and is based on Lunar Calendar</li>
</ul>
<p>Now these calculations have led us to a <strong>Thithi&nbsp;</strong>(Day). Let's see what makes a combination of Days, and a combination of those combinations!</p>
<ul>
<li>A combination of 15 <strong>Thithis </strong>(days) forms a <strong>Paksha </strong>and is named as <strong>Shukla </strong>or <strong>Krishna </strong>(Dark) based on the Moon's waxing&nbsp;and&nbsp;waning&nbsp;respectively. they form a day and night of a <strong>Pitr </strong>(our Ancestors) and is equal to a <strong>Masa </strong>(1 Lunar month)</li>
<li>2 <strong>Masas </strong>together form a <strong>Ritu </strong>(2 months / Season) and 3 <strong>Ritus </strong>form a <strong>Ayana </strong>(6 months)</li>
<li>2 <strong>Ayanas </strong>form a <strong>Samvatsara </strong>(1 year) and is named <strong>Uttara </strong>(North) and <strong>Dakshina </strong>(South) based on the Sun's movements</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we come to the end of part one where I explain how Hindu Almanac's accuracy describes what Time is and how it is to be calculated. Points to ponder are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is the current time calculation based on an atomic level of mathematics?</li>
<li>What exactly does Paramanu mean and why is it still being studied in modern Physics?</li>
<li>How are terms like Tyndall effect and many more being still developed whereas it has already been explained in a very detail manner in Vedas?</li>
<li>What is a cycle of life and where do the so called "Gods" in Hindu's way of life come into picture?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try to explain these in my future posts. I'm consulting various sources to help me analyze the meanings of these scriptures and it will be really if you could help me too in studying and correcting anything that I've already said :)</p>
