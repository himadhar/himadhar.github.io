<p>Recently, I came across this effect called the "Diderot effect". I was personally very familiar with this uncontrollable urge to make things in sync. I realised that it all started with the first couple of things I began with. Soon enough, I googled and found out about it!</p>

<p>The Diderot effect is a phenomenon named after the French philosopher Denis Diderot and was coined in 1988 by Grant David McCracken. It refers to people's tendency to want more possessions after acquiring a new, desirable item. As part of his essay "Regrets on Parting with My Old Dressing Gown", he writes about how he came across a new dressing gown as a gift and all the things that happened after that.</p>

<p>Once he received the gift of this beautiful scarlet dressing gown, his perception of things around him changed. The chair he sat on didn't match his dress, so bought a new one. The writing table didn't match the new chair that he bought, so he bought a new table. This went on and on spiralling into a whole new spending spree. He became a slave of his possessions! This is the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The idea can further be simplified as - the desire for additional possessions can lead to a spiral of consumption, as acquiring new items often creates a need for even more items to go along with them. For example, if you buy a new, expensive piece of furniture, you might then feel the need to buy new decorative items or even paint your walls to match the furniture. This desire for more possessions can be challenging to break, and can ultimately lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and even debt. It's important to be mindful of this effect and avoid falling into a cycle of excessive consumption.</p>
