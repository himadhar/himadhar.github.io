<h2>Preface</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I recently concluded learning an online course about User Experience. It was (amazingly) curated by Google and provided by Coursera as a certificate course. I have been designing and developing for over 11 years (as I write this) and I still was surprised to learn newer things! </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The best of it was around the context of staying organized in the approach. There was a lot of stress around it and quite a few references were provided on those lines. I wanted to stay on my toes with respect to the design ecosystem and this certificate program helped me with it. </p>

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this series of "Design Notes" based posts, with this being the first of it - I intend to curate notes on corrections one can focus on while designing.  It could be the steps to complete an activity, choosing right from wrong, how to decide right from wrong, concepts around colors, and a lot of it. Let's quickly dive into it!</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Note - 1</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This note is about how to approach any design project you encounter. I have focused on the steps you might need to take before starting any project. Not about the specific tool itself, but rather on the checklist of rules to be ready with, before starting the project.</p>

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Who your audience is, almost always solves your initial hiccup of design direction.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Let's discuss this with an example. Swiggy is an online food ordering and delivery platform in India and caters to tier-1 cities. They have now grown into tier-2 cities and in some places, tier-3 too. What comes to your mind when we discuss the target audience for an app like Swiggy? Tech-savvy? Too less time to cook? Want to try restaurant food without visiting one (could be because of lack of time, or laziness) ? </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are quite a few things to observe when finalizing the target audience you must have for your initial/MVP release. Here is a couple of them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Devices to support</li>
<li>Frequency</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Always start off with tried and tested approaches and then deviate slowly once you gain confidence. There are 2 parts to this statement; </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Tried and tested approaches:</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A use case to elaborate on this would be - A bottom navigation control in a mobile layout adds a lot of value to those platforms. The phone is usually held in a particular manner and the user's thumb ends up covering just about30% of the bottom of the phone. If the user is presented with a bottom navigation control, content can be viewed unobstructed visually while navigation (minimum coverage can be top-level navigation).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Deviate once you gain confidence:</h4>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once the use case is established, and based on feedback from your usability testing stages, you might end up breaking the "tried and tested" ones with your "experiments" and if you are happy with the results post the change, then definitely go ahead making them part of the final designs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The initial steps while designing should ensure only covering the ground. <br />- If all the articulated stages are drafted into logical groups (Information Architecture) and the major page(s) - could be a dashboard, landing page, profile - and, <br />- If the page covers basic controls and navigation system to a satisfactory level, you can then,<br />You can proceed with your design with the actual controls you want to implement. Maybe you don't want to go with the bottom navigation control or maybe you want to splurge your design with colors. But, these can always start once your basic data is organized (Information Architecture) and elementary designs are ready to validate your idea.</p>

<h2>Simplicity</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Simplicity over features is a great mantra.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember any of the design processes you are familiar with. For every step, there could be multiple steps within. Be aware of them too.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The design must and always should be based on the users. If the users are mostly mobile-driven, then a mobile-first design and so on.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Note 1 turned out to be great! I will add more such notes as I gather them,</p>
