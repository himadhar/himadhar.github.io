<p>This blog will take you through adding a left nav bar to your app - one that is purely CSS driven, with animation and etc etc â˜º.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There are 100s and 1000s of plguins to achieve what you have in mind. But, it could also mean that you would have to bear the additional load in the form of features and functionalities (almost useless to you) along in your application.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am definitely not terming the features they offer as useless. But, I am terming them useless to you - only if you needed the left tree/navbar to work for a simple use case where you need to just make it show and hide on demand and nothing else. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My goal is to create one such basic structure where you could go ahead and build something as simple as;</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;div this-is="root">
    &lt;div this-is="left-navbar">
    &lt;/div>
    &lt;div this-is="everything-else">
    &lt;/div>
&lt;/div></code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here, <code>root </code>is where you have the parent container, <code>left-navbar</code> is where the entire left navbar resides and toggles to show or hide and <code>everything-else</code> is where your body of content goes into.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
